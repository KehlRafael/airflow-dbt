# ELT with Airflow and dbt Core on Postgres

This is a modified version of the [Official Apache Airflow 2.2.2 Docker Compose](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.2/start/docker.html) to include `pgAdmin` and `dbt Core 1.2.0` to allow the user to run the project's DAGs as well as query the Airflow Postgres database to inspect the data generated by the ELT process without relying on any other software installed in the machine.

This is not a production-ready container image and has many issues, such as unencrypted credentials and the use of Airflow's database and credentials by other applications. The goal of this project is to provide a starting point for those that want to learn more about dbt and Airflow.

## Prerequisites
This project requires only Docker to run the ETL DAGs and dbt project, but you will need dbt Core 1.2.0 to host the dbt documentation if you want to.

To install Docker, please refer to their [official website installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

To install dbt Core you can also follow the [official website installation guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/pip-install) and install the Postgres adapter, or simply run the command below:
```
pip install dbt-postgres==1.2.0
```
With Docker and dbt installed you are ready to start!

## Get started
First clone the repository into your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/KehlRafael/airflow-dbt-imdb-elt.git
cd airflow-dbt-imdb-elt
```

### Running the containers
To run the containers specified in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file you can simply run:
```
docker compose -p imdb_ratings up -d
```
There is no need to build the image beforehand. All containers will be listed under the `imdb_ratings` project.

### Accessing the UI
To access the Airflow UI you must:
- Open the Airflow UI at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- Username: airflow
- Password: airflow

These are the default values in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). These values can be overwritten by adding to [.env](.env) the variables `_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME` and `_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD`, they will set the username and password, respectively.

To access the `pgAdmin` UI you must:
- Open the `pgAdmin` UI at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: admin

These are the default values in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). These values can be overwritten by adding to [.env](.env) the variables `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`, they will set the email and password, respectively.

In addition, if you have a preferred way to connect to and query databases, you can check the [pgpass](pgpass) and [servers.json](servers.json) files to get more information on the connection string needed to connect to the Postgres database used by this project.

### Stopping and removing images
To stop the containers run:
```
docker compose -p imdb_ratings stop
```
To tear down the environment run:
```
docker compose -p imdb_ratings down
```
You can add the `-v` and `--rmi local` flags at the end to also remove volumes and images, respectively, associated with the project.
